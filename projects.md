* SuperMarx, an aggregator of supermarket products.

# Past projects
* [`splang`](https://github.com/Wassasin/splang), a compiler for the Simple Programming Language in Haskell (for the Compiler Construction course at the RU).
* [RUnieuws](http://runieuws.nl/), a scraper of the previously hidden news website of the RU (defunct).
