I am Wouter Geraedts, a graduate student at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](http://www.ru.nl/), in The Netherlands. I am currently working to get my [Mathematical Foundations of Computing Science (MFoCS)](http://www.ru.nl/masters/programme/science/mathematics/specialisations/foundations/) graduate (master's) degree. Professionally I have worked on several websites and mailing systems. Currently I am working on several concepts involving (web)scrapers.
