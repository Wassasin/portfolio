I am Wouter Geraedts, a graduate student at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](http://www.ru.nl/), in The Netherlands. I am currently working to get my master's degree in the [Mathematical Foundations of Computing Science (MFoCS)](http://www.ru.nl/masters/programme/science/mathematics/specialisations/foundations/). Professionally I have worked on several websites and mailing systems. Currently I am working on several concepts involving (web)scrapers.

# Personal

I am an active [climber](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AtMapdKt3g) and swimmer (almost for free thanks to the [USC](http://www.ru.nl/sportcentrum/)). I also love to read (fantasy) books, and am a fan of Robin Hobb's and Robert Jordan's work. My [list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Wassasin) of watched anime-series is extensive. Finally, I am a member of the student sect [#RU](http://hashru.nl). But nothing beats my primary hobby: developing software.
